Simple Chatty Bot Project

The object of this project was to implement a bot that performs several functions.
There are 6 methods: greet(), remind_name(), guess_age(), count(), test(), end()

Greet() takes two arguments: bot_name and birth_year; this method uses these arguments to
  greet the user by stating his and the year it was created.
  
  
Remind_name() is a method used to ask the user their name.


Guess_age() guesses the user's name based off of three numbers: all of which are remainders 
  of the user's age divided by 3, 5, and 7, respectively (these remainders are provided by 
  the user. An equation is then used to determine the user's age.
  
  
Count() calls for the user to input a number. The bot then prints the range of numbers 
  from 0 to the user's input, each followed by a space and exclamation point.
  
  
Test() gives the user a programming-related multiple-choice question and prompts the user to
  repeatedly answer until they answer correctly.
  
  
End() congratulates the user for getting through the program
